    <p class="desc">ASW is another step towards classroom automation. Where traditional roll-calling takes 5-10 minutes to finish, ASW focuses on trimming it down to 5-10 seconds. Although ASW automates the process, it doesn't completely remove the manual entries. Faculty can still manually edit attenadances.</p>
